# JWT Authentication with Flask
The Main goal of this project is to be able to perform the JWT authentication on a flask web app so that it can be used in my later projects and basically a simple way to protected myself and other people out there from these attacks.
## Progress
The Project is Currently under production, For this project I have given myself a week to complete, which is too much, though I would get extra time to add some sources for people out there and properly comment the code.
